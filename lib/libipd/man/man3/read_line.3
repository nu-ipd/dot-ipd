.SH "DESCRIPTION"
These three functions read a line at a time either from
.BR stdin (4),
as
.B read_line
and
.B prompt_line
do, or a from file handle
.IR stream ,
as
.B fread_line
does.
.PP
The pointer returned by these functions is allocated
using
.BR malloc (3),
and thus must be freed using
.BR free (3)
when you are done with it. This is because unlike other input functions,
they allocate their own buffer, growing it as necessary to accept any
amount of input (limited, of course, by the computer\(aqs memory).
.PP
All three functions read until reaching either end-of-file
or a newline character. The newline character, if present, is not
included in the resulting string. If no characters can be read
before end-of-file is reached, the functions return a NULL pointer.
.PP
Additionally,
.BR prompt_line ()
prints a prompt to
.BR stdout (4)
and flushes it to ensure it is displayed immediately even if it
doesn\(aqt end with a newline.
.BR prompt_line ()
takes a format string and arguments to interpolate, in the style of
.BR printf (3).
.SH "ERRORS"
If any of the three functions fails to allocate memory,
it prints an error message
to
.BR stderr (4)
and calls
.BR exit (3)
with an error code of 1.
.\"
.SH "BUGS"
Almost all uses of
.B prompt_line
on IPD homework assignments are bugs, because none of the
assignments specify prompts, and all are strict about output.
